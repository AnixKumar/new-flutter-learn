# flutter_application_learn

A new Flutter project by Animes Ashis Kumar to understand and implement basic flutter app and write unit test cases along with Integration tests.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo and setting up the project, we will be using 'flutter run' command to run the project. I have made few changes for Home button, or the colors, and a bit of padding(lengths). 
PS: I have used a physical android device to run the app in debug mode and also the tests.

## Unit Test

The test/main_test.dart contains some of my self created unit test. Though they are very basic, they just tend to test the widgets available on screens. When in root directory, use the command in terminal 'flutter test test/main_test.dart'.

## Integration Test

The integration_test/main_it_test.dart contains some of my self created integration test. Though they are very basic, they just tend to test the widgets available on screens on a single go. When in root directory, use the command in terminal 'flutter test integration_test/main_it_test.dart'
